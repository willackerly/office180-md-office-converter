## Code

```
def convert(src, out_path):
    return out_path
```

## Blockquote

> A blockquote line that spans two source lines and should join into one paragraph.

## Links and horizontal rule

An absolute link (https://example.com/docs) keeps its label and gets its URL appended in parens.

Final paragraph mixes three separate inline spans in one line: **bold**, *italic*, and `code`, each its own span rather than nested inside another.
