# Quick Context

<!-- FRESHNESS: Update this date every time you modify this file -->

**Current state of the project for agents starting a new session.**

---

## Branch & State

- **Active branch:** `main`
- **Last deploy:** not applicable — this is a CLI tool distributed as source, not a deployed service
- **Environment:** any Python 3.9+ with `python-docx` installed
- **Packaging:** none yet — run `python3 md2docx.py` / `python3 docx2md.py` directly (see `ROADMAP.md` §0 for the planned `pyproject.toml` + `pipx` packaging)

## Test Status

- **Unit/round-trip tests:** 7 passing, 0 failing, 0 skipped — `python3 tests/test_roundtrip.py`
- **Coverage shape:** theme deep-merge + template resolution order, provenance stamp fields, full kitchen-sink forward→reverse round trip (structural spot-checks + word-bag comparison), link-demotion edge case, `--no-footer` regression
- **Enforcement scripts:** `check-contract-refs.sh`, `check-todos.sh`, `check-freshness.sh`, `check-ground-truth.sh`, `check-compliance.sh` all pass as of the freshness date above

## What's Next (in priority order)

<!-- This is the SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH for priorities.
     TODO.md has task details, but this list sets the order.
     Work top to bottom. -->

1. Package as `pyproject.toml` with a `pipx`-installable entry point (`ROADMAP.md` §0 / §8 P0)
2. Swap the hand-rolled line parser for a `markdown-it-py` CommonMark AST (`ROADMAP.md` §0 — the one architectural decision that unblocks everything else)
3. Real hyperlinks (`w:hyperlink` runs) instead of the current label/URL demotion (`ROADMAP.md` §5.1)
4. Nested lists + real Word numbering instead of the literal-text numbered-list workaround (`ROADMAP.md` §5.2)

## Active Work

**Current focus:** initial public release — the tool pair (v0.2.0), theme
system, round-trip test suite, and rebar Tier 3 scaffolding are complete
and this is the baseline for future work.

**In progress:**
- None — this is a clean baseline commit set, not mid-refactor.

**Recently completed:**
- Forward converter (`md2docx.py`) with theme deep-merge, template
  resolution, and DOCX provenance stamping (core-props stamp shipped in
  v0.2.0)
- Reverse converter (`docx2md.py`): style-driven inversion back to
  canonical Markdown
- Three shipped themes (`neutral`, `plum`, `marked-docs`)
- Three contracts (`C1-THEME-SCHEMA`, `C2-PROVENANCE`, `C3-ROUNDTRIP`),
  all `verified`
- `tests/test_roundtrip.py` — 7 tests, includes a `--no-footer` regression
  fix (the flag was accepted but not wired to the converter before this
  release)
- Rebar Tier 3 enforcement (`.rebarrc`, `.rebar-version`, `scripts/check-*.sh`, `METRICS.md`)
- `SVG-TO-EDITABLE-PPTX.md` — an SDK-neutral companion playbook for
  reconstructing SVG designs as editable PowerPoint objects, preserving
  stable source IDs and provenance, validating in native PowerPoint, and
  reconciling later slide edits back to the canonical source

**Blocked:**
- None currently.

## Key Decisions

**Architecture decisions:**
- Style-driven round trip, not byte-for-byte symmetry: the forward
  converter's choice of Word style *is* the contract the reverse converter
  inverts (`architecture/CONTRACT-C3-ROUNDTRIP.1.0.md`)
- Theme-as-data: every visual choice is a JSON key, not a code branch
  (`architecture/CONTRACT-C1-THEME-SCHEMA.1.0.md`)
- Provenance via standard OPC core properties, not a custom file format —
  survives a Word save because it's a part every conforming reader
  preserves (`architecture/CONTRACT-C2-PROVENANCE.1.0.md`)
- Rebar Tier 3 (Enforced), but scoped to what a solo-maintained CLI tool
  actually needs — no rebar Steward, no ASK CLI, no `ci-check.sh`; see
  `.rebarrc` and `architecture/README.md`

**Tech stack:**
- Python 3, stdlib + `python-docx` (the only runtime dependency)
- No test framework dependency — `tests/test_roundtrip.py` runs standalone

**Process decisions:**
- Contract-first for the theme schema, provenance stamp, and round-trip
  guarantee — those three are the parts other code (and future agents)
  depend on staying stable
- Two-tag TODO system (`TODO:` blocks commit, `TRACKED-TASK:` is tracked
  in `TODO.md`) enforced by `scripts/check-todos.sh`

## Context for Agents

**Project scope:** a Markdown↔DOCX converter pair for people who write
documentation in Markdown but need a themed, print-quality Word document
(and, less commonly, need to bring Word edits back into Markdown).

The repository also carries one documentation-only companion workflow:
`SVG-TO-EDITABLE-PPTX.md`. It applies the same deterministic mapping,
provenance, and reverse-inspection principles to SVG-to-PowerPoint
reconstruction. It does not add a presentation CLI or runtime dependency.

**User personas:** a developer or technical writer converting one-off
Markdown files to DOCX for a non-technical audience; someone who wants a
DOCX round-trip because a collaborator only edits in Word or Google Docs.

**Key constraints:**
- Single-maintainer project — keep the dependency surface minimal
  (`python-docx` only) and the enforcement scripts proportionate to that
  (see `.rebarrc`'s note on why there's no Steward here)
- Public repo (MIT) — nothing project-specific or confidential belongs in
  shipped themes or docs; see `TODO.md` for anything flagged along those
  lines

**Integration points:** none — this is a standalone CLI tool with no
external services, databases, or APIs.

## Current Architecture

**Contracts:**
- `CONTRACT-C1-THEME-SCHEMA.1.0` — verified
- `CONTRACT-C2-PROVENANCE.1.0` — verified
- `CONTRACT-C3-ROUNDTRIP.1.0` — verified

**Components:**
- `md2docx.py` — forward converter (Markdown → DOCX)
- `docx2md.py` — reverse converter (DOCX → canonical Markdown)
- `themes/` — three shipped JSON themes
- `architecture/` — the three contracts + registry
- `scripts/` — rebar Tier 3 enforcement
- `tests/` — round-trip test suite + kitchen-sink fixture
- `SVG-TO-EDITABLE-PPTX.md` — presentation reconstruction and round-trip
  playbook (documentation only)

**Dependencies:**
- `python-docx` (runtime)
- Rebar framework v3.0.0 (methodology only — no rebar binaries vendored
  into this repo)

## Agent Guidelines for This Project

**When working on this project:**

1. **Check this file first** — understand current state before making changes
2. **Update this file** — when you change project state, update relevant sections
3. **Follow contract-first approach** — a change to theme keys, the
   provenance stamp fields, or the round-trip inversion table touches a
   contract; update the contract alongside the code
4. **Maintain quality gates** — run `scripts/check-*.sh` and
   `python3 tests/test_roundtrip.py` before committing

**Project-specific considerations:**
- The project is two flat Python files at repo root, not a `src/`-layout
  package — enforcement scripts are written for that (see `scripts/README.md`)
- The marking-style banner feature (`**CUI...**` first line) is generic
  and intentionally documented with a placeholder example
  (`**CUI//TEST**`) — never reference a real classification or
  confidentiality marking scheme in this repo
